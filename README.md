# HOI4_TDE

Learning the basics of scritping HOI4 Mods.

12/22/2020 - Added basic loading screen tips, replaced a few of the loading screen quotes with in-universe character quotes. Looking to hopefully be done with this part of the project by 12/23/2020. Also have uploaded my flag assets, and some basic MS Paint map frameworks for how the national borders and names should look like. Only finished with the USA and Africa maps, still need South America, Europe, Russian sphere, and Asia. 

Changed South Africa's color to Scarlett Red.


2/12/2021 - Haven't been working on this as of late since I've been distracted by other projects, but I think I might spend a few hours today changing some more god-forsaken party and country names again. Ever since running into this part of the mod, I've found myself too bored to get much done. It is painstakingly tedious to do, but I'll have to get it done eventually. If any random HOI4 nerd is here reading this, I would love some assistance if you're down! Add me on Discord @cparks19998888#1247
