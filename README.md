# HOI4_TDE

Learning the basics of scritping HOI4 Mods.

12/22/2020 - Added basic loading screen tips, replaced a few of the loading screen quotes with in-universe character quotes. Looking to hopefully be done with this part of the project by 12/23/2020. Also have uploaded my flag assets, and some basic MS Paint map frameworks for how the national borders and names should look like. Only finished with the USA and Africa maps, still need South America, Europe, Russian sphere, and Asia.
